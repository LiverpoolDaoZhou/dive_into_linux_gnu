# GCC
## Option
### Debugging Program
- g: Produce debugging information in the operating systemâ€™s native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF). GDB can work with this debugging information.

### Optimization
- O: Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the program.

### Controlling the Kind of Output
- c: Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link. The linking stage simply is not done. The ultimate output is in the form of an object file for each source file.

# GDB
## Option
- silent: Do not print version number on startup.
